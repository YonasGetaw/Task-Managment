Professional To-Do Task Manager
This repository contains a modern, intuitive, and visually cohesive web application designed to empower users in efficiently managing their daily tasks. Developed with a strong focus on user experience, functional completeness, and impeccable visual consistency, this project serves as a benchmark for professional web design utilizing cutting-edge frontend technologies.

‚ú® Features
The Professional To-Do Task Manager offers a robust set of features to handle the complete task lifecycle:

Task Addition:

Intuitive input field for adding new tasks.

Optional Due Date and Time specification for each task.

Real-time validation prevents adding empty tasks, providing clear user feedback.

Dynamic Task Presentation:

Tasks are displayed in a clear, scrollable list.

Visual Cues: Completed tasks are visually distinct (e.g., strikethrough, muted color).

Overdue Indication: Uncompleted tasks that have passed their due date are highlighted with specific styling (e.g., red text, distinct background) to draw immediate attention.

Intelligent Sorting: Tasks are sorted to prioritize overdue tasks first, followed by pending tasks, and then completed tasks, ensuring critical items are always at the top of the list.

Effortless Status Management:

Users can easily toggle a task's completion status with a dedicated button/icon.

Visual updates are immediate, reflecting changes in status.

Streamlined Task Removal:

A clear "Delete" option allows users to remove tasks permanently from their list.

Intelligent Task Filtering:

Filter options (All, Pending, Completed) allow users to customize their task view.

The active filter is clearly indicated.

Time-Limit & Notifications:

Ability to set a specific due date and time for each task.

An automated notification system actively monitors tasks. If a task becomes overdue and is not yet completed, a prominent alert message appears at the top of the application, listing the overdue tasks. This notification is temporary and can be manually dismissed.

üíª Technologies Used
The application is built using standard web technologies for a lightweight, performant, and maintainable solution:

HTML5: Provides the semantic structure of the web page.

CSS3: Handles all styling and visual presentation.

Tailwind CSS: Used as a utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent styling, ensuring responsiveness and a modern look.

Custom CSS: Minimal custom CSS is used for specific element styling and overrides where needed, particularly for task item layouts and overdue states.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): Powers all interactive elements, dynamic content rendering, task state management, validation, filtering, and the notification logic.

Font Awesome: Utilized for a set of professional and easily scalable icons, enhancing the user interface's clarity and aesthetic.

üé® Design & User Experience Principles
Unified Aesthetic: A meticulously crafted and consistent color palette is applied throughout the application, fostering a professional and harmonious visual experience.

Intuitive Interface: Elements are organized logically, ensuring ease of use and a low learning curve for new users.

Responsiveness: Engineered with a mobile-first approach, the application adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) and orientations, ensuring optimal usability across devices.

Clear Feedback: All user actions and system states (e.g., task added, validation errors, overdue tasks) are accompanied by immediate and clear visual feedback.

Accessibility (Aria Attributes): Basic ARIA attributes (aria-label, aria-pressed) are included for improved accessibility for users relying on assistive technologies.
